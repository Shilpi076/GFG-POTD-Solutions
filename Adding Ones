Solution :-
=> All the elements with index greater than and equal to index given in update array will be incremented by one.
=> So, instead of incrementing all the elements after the given index in update array by one, we will only increment the value with the index given in update array and use 
   cumulative sum approach to update the rest of the array.
   Code :-
     for(int i = 0; i < k; i++)
            a[updates[i]-1]++;
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++){
            a[i] += a[i - 1];
        }
