Solution :-
=> To count number of set bits in binary representation of a number we right shift the number and check if bitwise and of right shifted number with 1 is 1 or not, if it is 
   then we increment the count of number of set bits, this we do iteratively n times where n is the number of bits in the binary representation of a number, mostly assume n=32.
Code :-
  int setBits(int N) {
        // Write Your Code here
        int count = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<32; i++){
            if(1 & (N>>i)){
                count ++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
